    <h1> <b> <u> GLOBAL WARMING </u></b></h1>
  <p>Global warming is the long term rise in Earth's average temperature,primarily
    caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation,which release 
    greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.  This leads to several consequences like melting
    glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme weather events and threats to ecosystems and
    human health.</p>  
    <hr>
    <h2> CAUSES OF GLOBAL WARMING</h2>
    <h3>Human Activities:</h3> <p> The primary driver is the release of greenhouse gases from
        burning fossil fuels for energy , industrial processes and transportation. </p>
        <h3>Deforestation:</h3> <p> Trees absorb carbon dioxide,so cutting them
            down reduces the planet's ability to remove this gas from the atmosphere. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2> EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING</h2>
            <h3> Climate change:</h3> <p> This include more frequent and intense heatwaves,
           droughts,floods and storms.  </p>
           <h3>Healths impacts:</h3> <p> Extreme temperatures can cause health problems 
            like heatstrokes and change in weather patterns can contribute to the spread of 
            diseases.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>SOLUTIONS OF GLOBAL WARMING</h2>
            <h3> Renewable energy:</h3> <p> transitioning to souces like solar and wind
                power reduces reliance on fossil fuels.  </p>
                <h3>Afforestation and reforestation</h3> <p> Panting more trees is crucial
                    for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </p>
